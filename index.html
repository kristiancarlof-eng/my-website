    <p>
      Hi love,<br><br>
      I wanted to do something small but special for us.
      Another year with you somehow feels both fast and forever.
      Thank you for being my favorite person, my safe place,
      and the one I want to share all the ordinary and extraordinary moments with.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t say this enough, but I really appreciate you —
      your patience, your laugh, the way you make everything feel lighter
      just by hearing your voice.
    </p>

      <p>
        First anniversary, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
        You encourage me, challenge me, and make me want to be better every day. 
        Obviously, I give all the glory to our God for bringing us together, but I also want to say thank you for saying yes to this adventure with me.
        I pray that the Lord guides both of our hearts to keep loving each other well, and that we continue to grow in grace and kindness together. 
        I also pray that we learn to cry out to God together in the hard seasons, and that we never stop choosing God's will for our lives and our relationship. I love you so much, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.
        Let us keep in mind that God is the center of our relationship, and that with Him, we can overcome any obstacle and celebrate every joy together.
        On a serious note, let no one separate what God has joined together. Here's to many more years of love, laughter, and faith with you.
        God bless us on this special day and always.

        I love you, Joan Q. Valle

        One of my favorite moments with you is just enjoying your presence, even if we're not on the phone talking.
        I remember the night that we started keeping each other over the phone while we were both sleeping, and I woke up in the middle of the night to check to see if you were still there and just hear you breathe.
        That’s when I knew — I want to be your husband someday.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="promise" class="hidden">
      <p>
        I promise to keep choosing God, so that I can love you the way you deserve to be loved.
        On easy days and hard ones.
        To listen, to grow, and to never stop putting the effort.
        I know the wait is hard, but I also know that it’s worth it, and that God has something so good in store for us.
        I asked, and I received, and I will continue to ask and receive for us, because I believe in the power of prayer and in the goodness of God’s plans for us. 
        I now know the reward of hard work and patience, it is the asurance of God's promise to bless us abundantly in due time. I can’t wait to see how God continues to work in our lives and our relationship, and I’m so grateful to have you by my side through it all.
        I love you, and I’m committed to loving you.
